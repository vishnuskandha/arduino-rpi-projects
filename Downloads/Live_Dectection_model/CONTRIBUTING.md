### üß™ Testing

We use pytest for testing. Before submitting a PR, please ensure all tests pass:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=yolov13_detection --cov-report=html
```

### üìù Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Flake8** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking
- **Pre-commit** hooks for automated checks

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Check types
mypy src/

# Run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üöÄ How Can I Contribute?

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include details about your configuration and environment:**
  * Which version of YOLOv13 Live Detection Suite are you using?
  * What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
  * Are you running on CPU or GPU?
  * What Python version are you using?

### üí° Suggesting Enhancements

If you have a suggestion for a new feature or enhancement, please:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include mockups, screenshots, or examples** if applicable.

### üîß Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **If you've added code that should be tested**, add tests.
3. **If you've changed APIs**, update the documentation.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5. **Make sure your code lints**.
6. **Issue that pull request!**

### üìö Documentation

We love good documentation! Here are some areas where you can help:

* **Code comments** - Add clear, helpful comments to complex code
* **README updates** - Improve clarity, add examples, fix typos
* **API documentation** - Document new functions and classes
* **Tutorials** - Create example scripts or Jupyter notebooks
* **Translation** - Help translate documentation to other languages

### üß™ Testing

* **Write tests** for new features
* **Improve test coverage** for existing code
* **Report bugs** you find while testing
* **Test on different platforms** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### üêõ Bug Fixes

* **Fix typos** in code or documentation
* **Fix broken links** in documentation
* **Fix minor bugs** you encounter
* **Improve error messages** to be more helpful

## üé® Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Good examples:**
```
feat: add ensemble detection support

- Implement Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF)
- Add support for multiple model inputs
- Include performance benchmarks

Closes #123
```

```
fix: resolve memory leak in GPU inference

- Clear CUDA cache after each batch
- Add memory monitoring
- Optimize tensor allocation

Fixes #456
```

### Python Styleguide

* **Follow PEP 8** - Use Black for automatic formatting
* **Use type hints** - Add type annotations to function parameters and return values
* **Write docstrings** - Use Google or NumPy style docstrings
* **Keep functions small** - Aim for functions under 50 lines
* **Use descriptive names** - Variables and functions should be self-documenting

**Good example:**
```python
def detect_objects(
    image: np.ndarray,
    model_path: str,
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.25,
    iou_threshold: float = 0.45
) -> List[Detection]:
    """
    Detect objects in an image using YOLOv13.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image as numpy array (H, W, C)
        model_path: Path to YOLOv13 model file
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence for detections
        iou_threshold: IoU threshold for NMS
        
    Returns:
        List of Detection objects with bounding boxes and scores
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If model_path doesn't exist
        RuntimeError: If CUDA is not available for GPU inference
    """
    if not os.path.exists(model_path):
        raise ValueError(f"Model not found: {model_path}")
    
    # Implementation here...
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* **Use clear, concise language**
* **Include code examples** for all functions
* **Add screenshots or GIFs** for UI features
* **Keep it up to date** with code changes
* **Use consistent formatting** and structure
